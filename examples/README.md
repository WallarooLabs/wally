# Wallaroo Examples

Wallaroo examples are organized by language. In each language's top-level directory you will find instructions on how to set up the environment for that language, along with a listing of its examples and brief descriptions of what they demonstrate. Each example should have its own in-depth description inside its own directory.

The languages currently supported by Wallaroo are:
- [Pony](pony/)
- [Python](python/)
- [Golang](go/)
