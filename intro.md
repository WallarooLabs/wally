This document is has been written to take an application developer from zero knowledge about Sendence Wallaroo to being able to develop streaming Wallaroo applications in a local development environment.

## Intended Audience

We designed this document for programmers that want to jump right in and get started using Wallaroo.  Starting with installing all of the necessary components required for Wallaroo and launching an example application in a local development environment.

Although not required, you will get the most out of this tutorial if you have previous experience with an object-oriented language such as Java or C++.  Additionally, experience with stream processing and distributed computing systems and concepts would be helpful.

The language specific portions of the document, for example, the C++ guide, assume that you have previously developed using the language and are comfortable with setting up a development environment for it.

## Supported development environments

It is currently possible to develop Wallaroo applications on MacOS or Linux. This guide has installation instructions for MacOS and Ubuntu Linux. It's assumed if you are using a different Linux distribution that you are able to translate the Ubuntu instructions to your distribution of choice.

## What to Expect

This document is organized into a number of sections. We recommend that you start in a linear fashion through this book. To that end, please consider reading in order:

- "What is Wallaroo"
- "Core Concepts"
- "Developing with Wallaroo"

Once you have finished the "Developing with Wallaroo" section, you can then jump to documentation for the language you will be developing with.

### Core Concepts

Covers the concepts you'll need to understand in order to build a Wallaroo application. As much as possible, we will avoid being language specific and try to keep it generic, but from time to time we will have some examples in Pony.

### Developing with Wallaroo

The "Getting Started" section is all about getting your development environment setup and then compiling and running a Wallaroo application. The tools you will install then are useful when developing a Wallaroo application regardless of which language you are using. You may have to install additional tools later to support your language of choice.

By the time you are done with this, you will have touched many of the tools you'll use with Wallaroo as well has having run a Wallaroo application locally and shaken out any issues related to getting one setup. From there, you can proceed to documentation for your language of choice.
