## Should I open an issue?

## How to get help

You have a couple of different options on how you can get help from the Wallaroo community. If you are looking for an answer "right now," we suggest you give our IRC channel a try. It's `#wallaroo` on Freenode. If you ask a question, be sure to hang around until you get an answer. If you don't get one, or IRC isn't your thing, we have a friendly mailing list you can try. Whatever your question is, it isn't dumb, and we won't get annoyed.
