# Setting Up Your Environment for Wallaroo

It is currently possible to develop Wallaroo applications on MacOS or Linux. This guide currently has installation instructions for MacOS and Ubuntu Linux. It's assumed if you are using a different Linux distribution that you are able to translate the Ubuntu instructions to your distribution of choice.

## Set up Environment for the Wallaroo Tutorial

Create a directory called `~/wallaroo-tutorial` and navigate there by running

```bash
mkdir ~/wallaroo-tutorial
cd ~/wallaroo-tutorial
```

This will be our base directory in what follows. If you haven't already
cloned the Wallaroo repo, do so now:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sendence/wallaroo
```

Note: You need to login to GitHub for credentials

This will create a subdirectory called `wallaroo`.

## Install for your operating system

Next, follow the instructions for your operating system:

- [MacOS setup](macos-setup.md)
- [Ubunutu setup](linux-setup.md)
